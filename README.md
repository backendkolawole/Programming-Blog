# py-blog

`py-blog` is a Django Blog that allows users to create posts and multiple entries for each post topic. The blog contains a home page that shows all posts in chronological order and other pages that allow users to edit or delete existing posts. 'py-blog` is built with a user authentication and registration system. It is a Docker-based app and was deployed on Heroku. For the database, I created a Postgres database with Amazon RDS.
